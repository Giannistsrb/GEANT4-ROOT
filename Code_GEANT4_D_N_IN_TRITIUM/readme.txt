NEW GEOMETRY 12 DECEMBER 2024:
==============================
*In this code, the carbon  foil and oxygen foil has been added together in Collimator, 
Antiscatterer and in front of the Molybdenum foil*

-> Carbons: Collimator:                  d = 4um
            Antiscatterer:               d = 4um
            Foil in front of Molybdenum: d = 4um
            
            
-> Oxygens: Collimator:                  d = 6um
            Antiscatterer:               d = 6um
            Foil in front of Carbon:     d = 6um
            
-> Biasing factors: Oxygen:          100
                    Aluminum flange: 100 
                    Carbon:          1000
